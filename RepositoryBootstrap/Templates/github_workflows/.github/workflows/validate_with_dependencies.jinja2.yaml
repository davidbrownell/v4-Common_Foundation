# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# This GitHub workflow is used as a 2nd line of defense to validate the repository
# and any dependencies that rely on your repository for functionality and is called
# after a commit is merged into the default branch.
#
# If your repository matches the following criteria, there is no need for customization:
#
#   1) No repositories rely on this one for functionality.
#
# It is safe to continue without modifying this file if all of the above conditions are true.
# If not...
#
#   1) If you need to add/remove repositories that should be validated when changes are made to this one,
#      See the notes in this file under "#dependents"
